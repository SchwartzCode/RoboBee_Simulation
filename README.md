# Simulating Control of the 'Robobee' Using a Spiking Neural Network

This simulation builds off of the work done by Professor Silvia Ferrari and her Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls (LISC) group at Cornell. Information on what they did can be found here: http://lisc.mae.cornell.edu/LISCpresentations/SSCI_AdaptiveSpiking_Clawson17.pdf

## What are we doing differently?

I will be replicating the work done by Professor Ferrari's team, and will eventually simulate use of Memristive Devices as the synapses in the neural network. A simulation for these types of devices is being developed by the Adaptive Devices and Microsystems (ADAM) Lab at the George Washington University (GWU) under the leadership of Professor Gina Adam. 




P.S. I'll add more and clean this up in the future. I'd never done a Github README before, so I figured it would be a good idea to try it out :)
